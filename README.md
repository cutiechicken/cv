This project showcases the application of computer vision techniques
and augmented reality (AR) for planar object localization and 3D model rendering.
Utilizing ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) for feature extraction and BFMatcher for 
feature matching, the project demonstrates how to accurately locate a planar target in an 
image and overlay a 3D model onto it. The 3D model adjusts its position and orientation 
in real-time, tracking the movements of the planar target. 

Key Features:
Use of ORB for efficient feature extraction.
Feature matching with BFMatcher.
Real-time 3D model rendering on a located planar target.
Application of homography and perspective transformation for AR overlay.
